Odds Are To Do List:


The app needs to:
  - View notifications more neatly when logged in 
  - Need to replicate views for: 
    - Viewing a Challenge Request
      - Viewing the Challenge Request as the respondent
      - Viewing the Challenge Request as expired/not the actor
    - Viewing Challenge Response
      - Viewing as the recipient:
        - Before you respond
        - Once you respond
      - Viewing as the sender:
        - Before they respond

Strategy moving forward:
  - If the Odds Are is expired / in a different states than a request, just route to OddsAre view
